# Linux Console
A prototype of a low-cost Linux-based gaming console. (It's not based on Raspberry Pi.)

# Hardware

You can use any hardware you like. Minimum requirements:

- Dual-core 1GHz+ CPU
- 2GB of RAM
- HDMI port

For development, you may want a VGA port and a headphone jack on your device.  You can also probably get away with 1GB of RAM, but I can't make any guarantees. (The OS probably clocks in around 300MB of RAM, and a single HDMI-size texture can take 30MB of RAM, so you may not have much wiggle-room.)
