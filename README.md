# Linux Console
A prototype of a low-cost Linux-based gaming console. (It's not based on Raspberry Pi.)

# Hardware

You can use any hardware you like. Minimum requirements:

- Dual-core 1GHz+ CPU
- 2GB of RAM
- HDMI port

For development, you may want a VGA port and a headphone jack on your device.  You can also probably get away with 1GB of RAM, but I can't make any guarantees about how well things will run.

You can use your OS of choice. For controllers, as long as you install drivers, things should work. If they don't, or if you want to add your controller's drivers/config to the default, open a pull-request. 

Officially, we only support Lubuntu with a Logitech F310 controller (since that's what I use).
